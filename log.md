# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built simple chessboard with HTML, CSS. Pulled data from NYT developer API.

**Thoughts:** Good to do some CSS work today. Connecting to the NYT API was straightforward. Starting to think through how to expand on the Book List project for my UW class.

### Day 1: March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on front-end design of NYT API project (codename = SearchTimes). Created helper functions to format book title, author, and description to title case or sentence case. 

**Thoughts:** Initial design came together quickly. Need to better understand how to do visual design outside of VSCode. Struggling with justify-content: space-between on book cover images.
