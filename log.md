# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built simple chessboard with HTML, CSS. Pulled data from NYT developer API.

**Thoughts:** Good to do some CSS work today. Connecting to the NYT API was straightforward. Starting to think through how to expand on the Book List project for my UW class.
